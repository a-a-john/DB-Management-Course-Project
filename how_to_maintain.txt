Manually push changes to the public repo

Whenever you finish a feature that’s OK to show publicly:

Pull the changes into your public copy:

git pull <private-repo-URL> main


Remove any school-only files again if needed:

git rm path/to/school_file
git commit -m "Remove school-only files"


Push to your public repo:

git push origin main

👍 This keeps commit history intact
❗ Requires repeating the cleanup each time
